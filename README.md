Steve Jobs :
Be brave 😁 and follow the intuition and the voice inside❤. They are already well aware of who you really want to become✌. 

Have you ever said to yourself: I wanted to do that with my time🤨, but…? Overcome this, however, fears and obstacles. Be brave to follow the call within yourself😎.
